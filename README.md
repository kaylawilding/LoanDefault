# Loan Default Model

This app is deployed [here](https://loandefaultfrontend-eufvgwfuhyhpgzh9.westus-01.azurewebsites.net/), if you would like to try it out. 

In this repo, I am:
- 	Developing an example end-to-end ML pipeline for loan default prediction using Kaggle data, presenting results through FastAPI endpoints, containerized with Docker, and managed in Azure Container Registry
- 	Leveraging Azure App Services for app deployment and monitoring
- 	Registered and stored Docker images on [Docker Hub](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e3ed3c9c-c93d-4884-9283-b25ebdce4b8e) to ensure reproducibility and version control\

The data set comes from [Loan Default Prediction Dataset on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/yasserh/loan-default-dataset).
